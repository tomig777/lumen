# Lumen

Lumen is a personal productivity app built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Run locally

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Create a production build with `pnpm build`.

## GitHub Pages

Pushing to `main` runs the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`, which builds the app and publishes it to GitHub Pages.

On iPhone, open the published site in Safari and use **Share → Add to Home Screen** for an app-like full-screen launch.

The current app stores its demo content in this browser's local storage. It has no sign-in or cloud sync, so data does not automatically transfer between devices or browsers.
